Reqlite - RethinkDB in JavaScript
=====

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/neumino/reqlite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/neumino/reqlite)

## What is it?

Reqlite is an implementation of a ReQL server in JavaScript. Meaning that
you can connect to reqlite with the RethinkDB driver and send queries (create
a table, insert documents, filter them, open a chanfeed etc.

```
./bin/reqlite
```

## Does it work?

Most of the methods work. There are currently 2000+ tests passing.

## Why?

The main reasons why this project was started were:

- Provide an easy way for node developers to test their code without having
to start a RethinkDB server.
- Maybe Meteor will use it to build a mini-rethinkdb - See [meteor-rethinkdb](https://github.com/Slava/meteor-rethinkdb)
- Use it on Windows instead of running a Docker container in Vagrant
- Because it's kind of fun :-)


## Version of RethinkDB supported

It currently tries to match RethinkDB 2.0.x.


## Run tests

Most of the tests run queries against RethinkDB and reqlite at the same time, and compare the output.
Start RethinkDB on port `28015`
```
rethinkdb
```

And reqlite on port `28016`:
```
node ./lib/node.js --port-offset 1
```

If you are developing on reqlite, you may want to use
```
nodemon lib/node.js -- -L --port-offset 1 --debug
```

Then run:
```
npm test
```

## Roadmap
